      <p class="about-text">
      Breeze is a three-year-old Golden Retriever.
      Her favorite toys include squeeky toys, tennis balls, and bones.
      Some of her past-times include swimming, running, and eating.

    <p class="about-text">
    One time I took my dog on a walk.
    While we were walking, she broke off the leesh and went for a swim.
    While in the water, she spotted some ducks.
    When she tried to chase the ducks, they quickly flew away.

        Here is a photo of my dog eating icecream. She is eating vanilla icecream, because dogs can not eat chocolate.

        Here is a photo of my dog chewing on a bone. Aside from tennis balls, she loves bones because they taste good. Well, at least to her they do.
